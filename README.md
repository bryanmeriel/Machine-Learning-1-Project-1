CASE STUDY:

Predicting houses’ prices
The HousingDataSet.csv file contains data on sales used. It has 21,613 records containing details
on 21 attributes. The goal is to predict the price of a house based on its specifications.
Requirements:

1. Create dummy variables for the categorical predictors if needed it. Provide the used
references in your report.

2. Using Python, run a multiple linear regression with the output variable Price and set of
selected inputs.

What appears to be the 4 to 6 most important house specifications for predicting the
house's price? Specify the practical search algorithms used to determine that.

3. Use multiple linear regression to predict the prices of the two houses in the file using the
4 to 6-house specifications selected requirement number 2.

4. Use Python to build KNN classification models using K = 5 and K=10.
Determine which K gives a better prediction accuracy and use it to predict the prices of
the two houses in the cleaned data set file.

5. Compare the prediction performance of multiple linear regression achieved in
requirement 3 and the KNN classifier achieved in requirement 4.

6. Propose extra algorithm(s), not included in our lecture, compare, and discuss the results
(if any)

Deliverables:
1. Files of all the models built using multiple linear regression and KNN classifier (in
requirements 2 and 4).

2. A report in IEEE format that includes

• Abstract, introduction, survey, ...etc.
• Discussions
• Diagram, algorithms, pseudo-code, flowchart, graphs, ..etc.
• Results
• Conclusion
• References

3. All the Python code used to develop the models (provide all the developed .ipynb files)
Evaluation Criteria:

Grading is based on the attached Rubric:

Main Points:
1. Delivered report and overall match with others and internet

2. One-on-One discussion and/or presentation. Good to have power points.

3. -20% for late submission/day

4. Following the recommended format in writing the report and functions, including
references and questions/answers

5. Running and Understanding the code
